The five magnitudes of galaxies, and their corresponding uncertainties, were extracted from five DECam images of galaxy cluster Abell 2457, accessed from the Brown University physics department.
Spectroscopic redshift data was obtained from https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/

The two data sets are then joined on the galaxy's position (right ascension, declination), and cleaned. The resulting number of data points is ultimately limited by the number of existing spectroscopic redshift measurements.
