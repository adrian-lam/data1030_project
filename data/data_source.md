The five magnitudes of galaxies were extracted from five DECam images of galaxy cluster Abell 2457, accessed from the Brown University physics department.
Redshift data was obtained from https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/
The two data sets are then joined on the galaxy's position (right ascension, declination), and cleaned.
